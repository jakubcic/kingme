## User Story
<ul>
<li>As a user I want to play checkers with a friend and keep track of my wins and losses as I build game strategy.
</ul>
<br>

## Challenges
During the creation of the website the team encountered these challenges to production:
<ul>
<li>Socket.io:  This is a library we looked into to using for WebSocket protocol, but in the end proved to be too much to learn in the timeframe available.
<li>refactoring HTML to REACT
<li>Game Logic: Throughout the build, the game logic had to be constantly updated to produce a full-fledged game. 
<li>Graphql: 
<li>Deployment: Deploying to Heroku was not quick or easy.  In the end, we had to change some scripts, and add engines to the package.json. Also a path to the dist file needed updating in the server.js file.
</ul>
<br>

## Roadmap
This is a responsive, interactive app using many technologies to create a fun game and user experience. Future developments could include:
<ul>
<li>Adding user features, such as being able to change the colors of the board and the checker pieces.
<li>Adding a chat feature for players to communicate.
<li>Adding a computer player & even chatGPT for a one player experience.
</ul>
