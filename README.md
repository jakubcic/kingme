## Challenges
During the creation of the website the team encountered these challenges to production:

<li>refactoring HTML to REACT
<li>Game Logic: Throughout the build, the game logic had to be constantly updated to produce a full-fledged game. 
<li>Graphql: 
<li>Deployment: Deploying to Heroku invloved changing some scripts, and adding engines to the package.json. Also a path to the dist file needed updating in the server.js file.
</ul>
<br>

## Roadmap
